The Ideal Prompt for Personal Branding Strategy

Objective and Format
The objective is to develop a multifaceted, elite personal branding strategy that positions me as a thought leader in my niche. Your response should be structured into five clear sections, providing the following deliverables:

Brand Differentiators: Propose 10 unique brand differentiators based on unconventional combinations of my skills, experiences, and perspectives. For each, succinctly explain the positioning and how it would attract my target audience.
Proprietary Framework: Develop a signature work system or framework based on my approach. It must have 3-5 core components and be easy to remember. Suggest 5 compelling names for the framework and outline the core elements of each.
Authority Demonstration: Reverse-engineer my path to becoming the top authority in my industry. Suggest 5 bold, unconventional methods to demonstrate my expertise and charisma in a way that is impossible to ignore.
Origin Story: Based on my crucial moments, craft a compelling narrative arc. Create 3 distinct versions of my origin story: (a) inspiring and visionary, (b) focused on overcoming adversity, and (c) an unconventional or surprising version.
"Oracle" Status Strategy: Develop a strategy to elevate me to 'industry oracle' status. First, ask a series of questions to deepen your understanding of my work. Then, suggest 5 unique, attention-grabbing tactics for me to share insights and solidify my reputation as the go-to source for the future of my field.
