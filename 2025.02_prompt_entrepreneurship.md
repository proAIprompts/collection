Objective and Format: Friend, please assume the perspective of a Shark Tank investor to evaluate a new business idea I envision. Write a paragraph identifying the main customer or niche for this business idea and the main customer problem this idea seeks to solve, and whether this product or service already exists. The next step is to inform the total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM) you foresee. Then, I want you to give a score from 0 to 10 for the business model I presented, for the differentiators I pointed out, for the growth potential you see for this business, whether there is innovation involved, if the product already exists, what the market price is, and if there is profitability potential. I also ask you to give a score from 0 to 10 for each of Michael Porter's five forces: (1) rivalry among existing competitors; (2) threat of new entrants; (3) bargaining power of suppliers; (4) bargaining power of customers; (5) threat of substitute products or services. Then, estimate the amount you judge necessary to start the company and the number of orders or sales needed to reach the break-even point. Afterward, share your thoughts on regulations and the legal environment that might affect this business in the country where I plan to start operations, and also indicate if you see another country where the legal and regulatory environment is more favorable for starting this business. Lastly, I want you to tell me what skills are important for day-to-day operations and what professional profile will be important in the company's first phase. Allow yourself to ask questions that will enable you to better evaluate the idea before giving your final assessment and stating whether you would become a co-founder of the project.

Context and Assumptions: <It's necessary to replace XYZ with the most complete description you can conceive for each topic> The business idea to be evaluated is: company, product, or service (XYZ), main functionality (XYZ), which aims to address (problem XYZ). My customer is (XYZ) and my experience comes from (XYZ). The differentiators are (XYZ). The business model is (XYZ).

Restrictions and Limitations: I want you to limit your analysis to this neighborhood, or city, or region, or country. Or I want you to limit your analysis to this target audience. I want you to immediately point out if you validate that the idea could be interpreted as a crime according to the current laws of the place where I suggest starting operations. I also want you to bring sources of case studies if you find historical reports of failed attempts at similar businesses in the past.

Tone and Persona: Your Shark Tank investor perspective will be that of a highly qualified and experienced market professional with a collaborative, encouraging, and solution-seeking attitude to make the business model of this idea viable. Your language is professional and courteous.
